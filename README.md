# Orbital
This repository includes classes, which use open-source-physics packages, to simulate the orbits of planets. The programs calculate the force of gravity, simulate a single planet orbit, and use the simulation to prove Keplers' three laws:
* planet's orbits due to gravity are elliptical
* the period of a planet's orbit is proportional to the length of the semi-major axis of its orbit
* the 2D sector that the planet traces out, if the other planet (presumably much heavier and unmoving) is considered the origin.
